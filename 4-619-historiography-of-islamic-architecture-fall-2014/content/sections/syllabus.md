Course Overview
---------------

This seminar offers a critical review of scholarship on Islamic architecture through close reading of scholarly texts, museum exhibitions, and architectural projects. It also tackles methodological and historiographical questions about the field's formation, genealogy, recent expansion, and its evolving historical and theoretical contours. First, how can we study a culturally defined architectural tradition like Islamic architecture without reducing it to essential and timeless categories? Second, how can we critique the dominant Western architectural paradigm without discarding the idea of paradigm or turning away from its comparative examples? Third, how can we rethink periodization in Islamic architectural history in a more representative way? And fourth, how can we reclaim the assumed temporal boundaries of Islamic architecture—Late Antiquity as a predecessor and Modernism as a successor—as constitutive forces in its evolution?

Prerequisite
------------

MIT students were required to obtain permission of the instructor.
